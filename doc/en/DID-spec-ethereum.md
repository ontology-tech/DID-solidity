# Ethereum DID Specification Draft v0.1

## Abstract

This specification describes a new DID method for hosting DIDs on the Ethereum blockchain, also referred to as Ethereum DID. This specification conforms to the requirements specified in the [DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.

## Conformance and Terminology

This specification assumes a fair degree of understanding of [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Ethereum DID Syntax

Ethereum DID is a URI conforming to [IETF RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986) and **SHOULD** be generated by each entity itself.

Ethereum DID is generated in conformity with [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The ABNF grammar used to generate the Ethereum DID identifier is as follows:

```
eth-did   = "did:etho:" eth-specific-idstring
eth-specific-idstring = 40*40HEXDIG
```

`did:etho:` denotes that Ethereum DIDs are decentralized identifiers conforming to [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and are  registered on the Ethereum blockchain.

Below is an example of a Ethereum DID:

```
did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121
```

## Ethereum DID Registration and Deactivation

Ethereum DID **MUST** be registered on the Ethereum blockchain to be activated, and the same Ethereum DID **MUST NOT** be registered more than once.

When a Ethereum DID is deactivated, all the related data including public keys, controllers, and other properties will be deleted and only a record of the Ethereum DID identifier will remain on the Ethereum blockchain.

A deactivated Ethereum DID can no longer be used and cannot be reactivated for use.

## Ethereum DID Document

Each Ethereum DID will have a corresponding Ethereum DID Document, which is a set of data describing this Ethereum DID.

Below is the basic structure of the Ethereum DID Document:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [...],
  "authentication": [...],
  "controller": [...],
  "service": [...],
  "created": "...",
  "updated": "..."
}
```

### Context

Ethereum DID Documents **MUST** include a `@context` property.

The value of the @context property **MUST** be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI **MUST** be [https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1](https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1). For more information, see [W3C DIDs specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#production-0).

Below is an example in which the `@context` property has two values:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1","https://www.eth.org/did/v1"]
}
```

### Identifiers

Ethereum DID Documents **MUST** include an `id` property.

The value of the `id` property denotes the Ethereum DID subject that the Ethereum DID Document is about.

The value of `id` **MUST** be a valid Ethereum DID. A Ethereum DID **MUST** have exactly one DID subject.

```json
{
  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
}
```

### Public Keys

A Ethereum DID Document **MAY** include a `publicKey` property to specify a set of public keys linked to that Ethereum DID.

Public and private key pairs can be used for the identity management, authorization, and verification of Ethereum DIDs. A Ethereum DID can be linked to multiple public and private key pairs and one pair of public and private keys can also be used to manage multiple Ethereum DIDs.

Every public key object linked to the `publicKey` property **MUST** include the fields `id`, `type`, `controller`  and specific public key properties, and **MAY** include other additional properties.

Each linked public key has its own identifier specified using the field `id`. The value of `publicKey` **MUST NOT** contain multiple entries with the same `id`.

Bound public keys can be revoked. Revoked public keys **MUST NOT** be reactivated, but can still possess the original `id`.

The value of the `type` field represents the corresponding public key type. Ethereum DID Documents support `Ed25519VerificationKey2018` and `EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019`.

The value of the `controller` field which identifies the controller of the corresponding private key **MUST** be a valid Ethereum DID, implying that the public key is controlled by this Ethereum DID.

The encoding formats that Ethereum DID Documents support include `publicKeyHex` and `publicKeybase58`. Public keys of all types **MUST** be expressed in these two formats.

Below is a specific example of the `publicKey` property:

```json
{
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
	  "controller": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Authentication

Ethereum DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `authentication` property to specify a set of verification methods.

A Ethereum DID subject could add the `authentication` property in its corresponding Ethereum DID Document to denote that the subject has authorized a set of verification methods for the purpose of authentication.

The associated value **MUST** be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method in the `authentication` property **MAY** be embedded or referenced.

Below is an example which refers to authentication keys in the two way specified above:

```json
{
  ...
  "authentication": [
	"did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-2",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyBaseHex": "03a835599850544b4c0a222d594be5d59cf298f5a3fd90bff1c8caa064523745f3"
	}
  ],
}
```

### Authorization and Delegation

In a Ethereum DID Document, an **OPTIONAL** `controller` property is included to assign one or more delegates.

A Ethereum DID can be delegated to and controlled by one or more distinct Ethereum DIDs.

A Ethereum DID delegate has the necessary authorization to insert a new verification method into the `authentication` property of the delegated Ethereum DID.

It is worth noting that a Ethereum DID Document can assign `controller` without defining the value of `authentication`.

The Ethereum DID Document of the delegate **SHOULD** have a `authentication` property.

Below is a specific example representing that either `did:etho:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9` or `did:etho:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2` can act as a delegate of `did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121`:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "controller": [
	"did:etho:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9",
	"did:etho:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2"
  ],
}
```

### Service Information

Ethereum DID Documents use an **OPTIONAL** `service` property to specify the service property.

Ethereum DID allows entities to add services and specify the relevant information of a service that is related to the particular Ethereum DID, including fields such as the type of service and service endpoint.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  ...
  "service": [
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#some-service",
	  "type": "SomeServiceType",
	  "serviceEndpoint": "Some URL"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Created

Ethereum DID Documents **SHOULD** include a `created` property to specify the time of creation.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#created).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  "created": "2018-06-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Updated

Ethereum DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `updated` property to specify a timestamp of the most recent change.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#updated).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  "updated": "2019-06-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Appendix

A simple example of a Ethereum DID Document is as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://www.eth.org/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256r1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
	}
  ],
  "authentication": [
	"did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1"
  ]
}
```
