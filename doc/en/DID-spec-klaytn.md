# Klaytn DID Specification Draft v0.1

## Abstract

This specification describes a new DID method for hosting DIDs on the Klaytn blockchain, also referred to as Klaytn DID. This specification conforms to the requirements specified in the [DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.

## Conformance and Terminology

This specification assumes a fair degree of understanding of [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Klaytn DID Syntax

Klaytn DID is a URI conforming to [IETF RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986) and **SHOULD** be generated by each entity itself.

Klaytn DID is generated in conformity with [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The ABNF grammar used to generate the Klaytn DID identifier is as follows:

```
klay-did   = "did:klay:" klay-specific-idstring
klay-specific-idstring = 40*40HEXDIG
```

`did:klay:` denotes that Klaytn DIDs are decentralized identifiers conforming to [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and are  registered on the Klaytn blockchain.

Below is an example of a Klaytn DID:

```
did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121
```

## Klaytn DID Registration and Deactivation

Kalytn DID can be automatically generated without registration for each Kalytn address.

When a Klaytn DID is deactivated, all the related data including public keys, controllers, and other properties will be deleted and only a record of the Klaytn DID identifier will remain on the Klaytn blockchain.

A deactivated Klaytn DID can no longer be used and cannot be reactivated for use.

## Klaytn DID Document

Each Klaytn DID will have a corresponding Klaytn DID Document, which is a set of data describing this Klaytn DID.

Below is the basic structure of the Klaytn DID Document:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [...],
  "authentication": [...],
  "controller": [...],
  "service": [...],
  "updated": "..."
}
```

### Context

Klaytn DID Documents **MUST** include a `@context` property.

The value of the @context property **MUST** be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI **MUST** be [https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1](https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1). For more information, see [W3C DIDs specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#production-0).

Below is an example in which the `@context` property has two values:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"]
}
```

### Identifiers

Klaytn DID Documents **MUST** include an `id` property.

The value of the `id` property denotes the Klaytn DID subject that the Klaytn DID Document is about.

The value of `id` **MUST** be a valid Klaytn DID. A Klaytn DID **MUST** have exactly one DID subject.

```json
{
  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
}
```

### Public Keys

A Klaytn DID Document **MAY** include a `publicKey` property to specify a set of public keys linked to that Klaytn DID.

Public and private key pairs can be used for the identity management, authorization, and verification of Klaytn DIDs. A Klaytn DID can be linked to multiple public and private key pairs and one pair of public and private keys can also be used to manage multiple Klaytn DIDs.

Every public key object linked to the `publicKey` property **MUST** include the fields `id`, `type`, `controller`  and specific public key properties, and **MAY** include other additional properties.

Each linked public key has its own identifier specified using the field `id`. The value of `publicKey` **MUST NOT** contain multiple entries with the same `id`.

Bound public keys can be revoked. Revoked public keys **MUST NOT** be reactivated, but can still possess the original `id`.

The value of the `type` field represents the corresponding public key type. Klaytn DID Documents support `EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020` and `EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019`.

The value of the `controller` field which identifies the controller of the corresponding private key **MUST** be a valid Klaytn DID, implying that the public key is controlled by this Klaytn DID.

The encoding formats that Klaytn DID Documents support include `publicKeyHex` and `ethAddress`. Public keys of all types **MUST** be expressed in these two formats.

Below is a specific example of the `publicKey` property:

```json
{
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	},
	{
	  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
	  "controller": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "ethAddress": "0xf269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Authentication

Klaytn DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `authentication` property to specify a set of verification methods.

A Klaytn DID subject could add the `authentication` property in its corresponding Klaytn DID Document to denote that the subject has authorized a set of verification methods for the purpose of authentication.

The associated value **MUST** be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method in the `authentication` property **MAY** be embedded or referenced.

Below is an example which refers to authentication keys in the two way specified above:

```json
{
  ...
  "authentication": [
	"did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	{
	  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-2",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "03a835599850544b4c0a222d594be5d59cf298f5a3fd90bff1c8caa064523745f3"
	}
  ],
}
```

### Authorization and Delegation

In a Klaytn DID Document, an **OPTIONAL** `controller` property is included to assign one or more delegates.

A Klaytn DID can be delegated to and controlled by one or more distinct Klaytn DIDs.

A Klaytn DID delegate has the necessary authorization to insert a new verification method into the `authentication` property of the delegated Klaytn DID.

It is worth noting that a Klaytn DID Document can assign `controller` without defining the value of `authentication`.

The Klaytn DID Document of the delegate **SHOULD** have a `authentication` property.

Below is a specific example representing that either `did:klay:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9` or `did:klay:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2` can act as a delegate of `did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121`:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "controller": [
	"did:klay:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9",
	"did:klay:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2"
  ],
}
```

### Service Information

Klaytn DID Documents use an **OPTIONAL** `service` property to specify the service property.

Klaytn DID allows entities to add services and specify the relevant information of a service that is related to the particular Klaytn DID, including fields such as the type of service and service endpoint.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  ...
  "service": [
	{
	  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#some-service",
	  "type": "SomeServiceType",
	  "serviceEndpoint": "Some URL"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Created

Kalytn DID Documents do not include a `created` property as Kalytn DID can be automatically generated for each Kalytn address.

### Updated

Klaytn DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `updated` property to specify a timestamp of the most recent change.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#updated).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  "updated": "2019-06-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Appendix

A simple example of a Klaytn DID Document is as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://www.eth.org/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	}
  ],
  "authentication": [
	"did:klay:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1"
  ]
}
```
